# GenAI Policy Assistant

An AI-powered multi-agent policy compliance assistant built using FastAPI, LangGraph, ChromaDB, Groq LLMs, and React.

The platform enables students to query university placement and internship policies using natural language and receive structured compliance decisions, semantic policy retrieval, citation-supported reasoning, and professional AI-generated responses.

The system demonstrates production-oriented Generative AI engineering concepts including:

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* semantic vector search
* multi-agent orchestration
* structured AI workflows
* cloud deployment infrastructure
* real-time frontend-backend integration

---

# Overview

University placement and internship policies are often lengthy, difficult to navigate, and manually interpreted by students and placement coordinators.

This project solves that problem by building an intelligent AI assistant capable of:

* retrieving relevant placement policy clauses
* evaluating policy compliance scenarios
* performing semantic policy search
* generating structured AI-based responses
* displaying explainable AI workflow execution

The platform combines a modern React frontend with a FastAPI + LangGraph backend deployed on Google Cloud Run.

# Multi-Agent Workflow

## 1. Searcher Agent

Responsible for semantic retrieval of university placement policy clauses.

### Responsibilities

* generate semantic embeddings
* perform ChromaDB vector search
* retrieve relevant policy chunks
* provide contextual evidence

### Technologies Used

* ChromaDB
* SentenceTransformers
* all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings

---

## 2. Judge Agent

Responsible for compliance evaluation and policy validation.

### Responsibilities

* interpret university placement rules
* validate user scenarios
* determine compliance status
* generate structured verdicts

### Technologies Used

* Groq API
* llama-3.1-8b-instant
* Pydantic schemas

---

## 3. Writer Agent

Responsible for generating professional structured responses.

### Responsibilities

* generate final AI response
* summarize policy reasoning
* include citations and explanations
* structure readable output

---

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The platform uses a semantic retrieval pipeline to improve factual grounding and reduce hallucinations.

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, install:

| Tool    | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Python  | 3.9+    |
| Node.js | 18+     |
| npm     | latest  |
| Git     | latest  |

# Backend Setup

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd genai-policy-assistant
```

---

## 2. Create Virtual Environment

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

---

## 5. Build Vector Database

```bash
python build_vector_db.py
```

This generates the ChromaDB vector index from the university placement policy document.
